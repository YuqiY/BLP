# BLP
My BLP Project for ASU ECN753

The processing_data.py is to process the product data to get the log market share differences for each market.

The OLS.py is to estimate the homogenous model using OLS.

The 2SLS.py is to use 2-stage LS and instruments to estimate the homogenous model.

The BLP.py is my attempt to duplicate the BLP estimation process.
